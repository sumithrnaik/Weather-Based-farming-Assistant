        <h2>Our Goal</h2>
        <p>At Weather-based Farming AI Assistant, our mission is to empower farmers with technology that enhances decision-making and improves agricultural efficiency. We aim to help farmers maximize crop yields, reduce water usage, and mitigate risks associated with changing weather conditions.</p>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Project Features</h2>
        <p><strong>Real-time Weather Data:</strong> Our platform integrates with a reliable weather API to fetch real-time weather data, including current temperature, humidity, and weather conditions, along with a 7-day forecast. This information is crucial for making informed farming decisions.</p>
        <p><strong>Crop Recommendations:</strong> Using a sophisticated machine learning model, we provide personalized crop recommendations based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH levels, and rainfall. Our model is trained to suggest the most suitable crops for your specific soil and environmental conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Irrigation Advice:</strong> Our AI-powered irrigation model takes weather data into account to offer precise irrigation advice. By predicting the exact amount of water needed (in mm), we help farmers optimize water usage, ensuring crops receive the right amount of hydration without wastage.</p>
